this is just a personal edit of the neato Nash's HP Bar mod to add some features that I want.
this version was intended to be used alongside another project I'm working on called "Box Party" (not yet released), see the link below if you wanna see that.

Original Description Below:
------------------
Nash's HP Bar v1.2
------------------

Just a HP bar. Nothing else!

Intentionally no customizability. I wanted to keep it clean and simple.

Can be toggled on and off. Useful in a coop game where some players may not
want their screen to be cluttered, but all players must have the mod loaded
to prevent desyncs.

The bar's position will always be drawn such so that it will never obscure
your pickup messages. It also respects message scale settings and the number
of lines as determined by the 'con_notifylines' CVAR.

Have fun!
